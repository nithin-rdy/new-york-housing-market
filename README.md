# New York Housing Market Price Prediction

This project uses machine learning models to predict and categorize housing prices in New York. We employ regression models for price prediction, classification models to label high and low prices, and optional clustering to explore data groupings. The project was developed in Google Colab, and code is documented in this repository.

## Dataset

Dataset: New York Housing Market from Kaggle, containing features such as:

- Location: Neighborhood and geographic details
- Property Details: Size, rooms, and amenities
- Price: Target variable for prediction

## Models

### Regression Models

- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regression
- Random Forest Regression
- Ridge and Lasso Regression

### Classification Models

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classification
- Random Forest Classification

### Optional Clustering

- K-Means Clustering for grouping analysis

### Evaluation Metrics

- Regression: MAE, MSE, R²
- Classification: Accuracy, F1 Score, Precision, Recall

### Project Structure
